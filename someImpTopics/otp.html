    toString(36) is a method in JavaScript that converts a number to a string
    representation in the base-36 numeral system. In the base-36 numeral system,
    there are 36 distinct symbols, which are the digits 0-9 and the letters A-Z.
    The number 10 is represented by the letter A, the number 11 is represented
    by B, and so on, up to 35, which is represented by the letter Z. Here is an
    example of using toString(36) in JavaScript: javascript Copy code let num =
    123456789; let str = num.toString(36); console.log(str); // "kf12oi" In this
    example, the number 123456789 is converted to a string in base-36, which is
    represented by the characters "kf12oi".
